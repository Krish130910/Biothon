# HealthGuard AI 🛡️

### AI-Powered Preventive Health Awareness & Risk Assessment Portal

HealthGuard AI is a modern, patient-first web application designed to help individuals evaluate their metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors before symptoms manifest. Leveraging **Gemini AI**, evidence-based clinical guidelines, and a beautiful, high-performance user interface, HealthGuard AI empowers users to identify chronic health risks (Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, and Heart Disease) in under 10 minutes and receive immediate, personalized, and actionable lifestyle guidance.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📋 1. Guided One-Time Health Assessment (Onboarding)

- First-time users are automatically redirected to a multi-step health questionnaire on signup/login.
- Once completed, returning users skip directly to the dashboard — no repeated questionnaires.
- Assessment covers: age, gender, height, weight, smoking, exercise, alcohol, family history, and current symptoms.
- Reassessment is available at any time from the **Profile** page.

### 📊 2. Intelligent Risk Dashboard

- **Clinical Risk Math**: Computes scores using **FINDRISC** (Type 2 Diabetes) and **Framingham** (Heart Disease & Hypertension) equations for clinical transparency.
- **Action Impact Engine**: Tests multiple realistic lifestyle changes, recalculates risk for each, and ranks them by impact. The dashboard says _"Exercise 30 min/day can reduce your risk by 19%"_ — not just a number.
- **Risk Driver Analysis**: Breaks down risk into weighted contributors (e.g. Sedentary Lifestyle 38%, BMI 27%) so users understand _why_ their risk is high.
- **Dynamic Journey Card**: Shows assessment completion status, recommended next step, and profile age.

### 🍱 3. Personalized Action Plan

- AI-generated weekly meal and activity plans tuned to regional cuisine (Indian veg/non-veg) and fitness level.
- Supports **English, Hindi, and Gujarati** language output.

### 🔍 4. Smart Food Scanner

- **Gemini Multimodal OCR**: Parses food packaging photos (drag-and-drop or live webcam) and extracts ingredients.
- **Personalized Impact**: Scores each food item against the user's specific risk profile — not generic nutrition advice.
- **Health Score (1–10)**: Reports glycemic (Diabetes), vascular (Hypertension), and cardiac impact separately.
- Offline fallback keyword evaluator when API is unavailable.

### 🩺 5. Human Expert Review

- Users can request their health summary be reviewed by a clinical expert.
- Real-time expert chat powered by **Firestore listeners** (with polling fallback).
- Expert portal at `/expert-dashboard` shows pending patient requests with full risk snapshots.
- Supports mock expert registration for development/demo environments.

### 📄 6. Clinician-Friendly PDF Reports

- Downloadable PDF health summaries via `jsPDF` for hospital portals or personal records.

### 🛡️ 7. Post-Generation Safety Guardrails

- Regex/word-matching validator on all AI recommendations redacts diagnosis assertions and drug prescription language, keeping all content strictly educational.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- A **Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- (Optional) Firebase project credentials for cloud sync

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Root (frontend)
npm install

# Backend
cd backend && npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

**Root `.env`** (frontend):

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-firebase-api-key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project.firebasestorage.app"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

**`backend/.env`**:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
# Optional: uncomment and set if you have a Firebase service account
# FIREBASE_SA_KEY_PATH="./service-account.json"
```

> **Note**: Without Firebase service account credentials, the backend automatically falls back to in-memory mock storage. This is sufficient for local development and demos.

### 3. Start Development Servers

**Both servers at once** (recommended):

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

**Or separately**:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Frontend (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Backend (http://localhost:5000)
cd backend && npm run dev
```

### 4. First-Time User Flow

1. Visit `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Sign up** or **Log in**
3. Complete the one-time **Health Assessment** (redirected automatically)
4. Land on your personalized **Dashboard** with risk profile, action impacts, and risk drivers

### 5. Production Build

```bash
# Frontend
npm run build

# Backend
cd backend && npm run build
```
